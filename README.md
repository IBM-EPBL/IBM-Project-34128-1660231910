# INTRODUCTION
  Food is essential for human life and has been the concern of many healthcare conventions. Nowadays 
new dietary assessment and nutrition analysis tools enable more opportunities to help people understand 
their daily eating habits, exploring nutrition patterns and maintain a healthy diet. Nutritional analysis
is the process of determining the nutritional content of food. It is a vital part of analytical chemistry
that provides information about the chemical composition, processing, quality control and contamination of food.

  The main aim of the project is to building a model which is used for classifying the fruit depends on the 
different characteristics like colour, shape, texture etc. Here the user can capture the images of different 
fruits and then the image will be sent the trained model. The model analyses the image and detect the nutrition 
based on the fruits like (Sugar, Fibre, Protein, Calories, etc.).
